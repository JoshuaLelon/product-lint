# Changelog

## 0.1.0

First public release.

Knowledge model:

- Five-level JSON knowledge DAG: Context, Product, Behavior, Architecture, Mechanism.
- Continuous top-down lineage and frontier diagnostics.
- File-to-knowledge and node-to-affected-files traversal.
- Mechanism ownership of implementation paths.
- Deterministic staged implementation and constraint digests.
- Git-anchored reference JSON validation.
- Query-scoped LLM text views.

Commits and hooks:

- Bidirectional staged commit validation.
- Exact `Knowledge-Change` Git trailer enforcement.
- The commit subject is unconstrained, so any team convention composes with it. Opt in to
  enforcing your own with `commit.subjectPattern` (`PL2205`, `PL2206`).
- `product-lint init` provisions the whole setup: `docs/` with a `.gitkeep` per level,
  Lefthook `pre-commit` and `commit-msg` commands (created, or appended to an existing
  config), and `lefthook install`.
- The pre-commit hook runs `knowledge sync --staged` and re-stages `docs/`, so no manual
  sync-and-restage step is needed.

Diagnostics:

- Every diagnostic carries a specific `fix`. A test fails if a new code ships without one.
- Diagnostics that need an answer from the user carry an `ask` field with three formats:
  draft to confirm, candidates to choose, and decision brief. Each costs the user a
  confirmation or a choice rather than an essay.
- Diagnostics that ask for prose carry a `style` field requesting ASD-STE100 Simplified
  Technical English. `product-lint llms` output carries the same rule.
- A missing configuration file reports `Run: npx product-lint init` rather than a raw
  `ENOENT` stack trace. Set `PRODUCT_LINT_DEBUG` for full stacks.
